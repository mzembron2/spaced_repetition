# Flashcard application using spaced repetition SM-2 method

Authors: [Maciej Groszyk](https://github.com/MaciejGroszyk), [Mateusz Zembro≈Ñ](https://github.com/mzembron)

## Introduction
This project is a simple flashcard application that helps you learn anything using [spaced repetition method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), which will allow you to do it noticeably faster. Flashcards can contain text, images, or sound (there is an easy way to add new ones through the application). The implemented algorithm calculates new repetition dates according to the [SuperMemo-2 method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo#Description_of_SM-2_algorithm).
